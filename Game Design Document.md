# 1. **Introduction**
### Ricochet Rumble expands on traditional pong by transforming the ball into a ticking time bomb that becomes increasingly unstable as players rally.
### The game explores whether adding pressure, chaos, and strategic risk enhances engagement beyond the original Pong’s simplicity.

# 2. **Gameplay**
### Ricochet Rumble is designed as a 2D arcade, two-player competitive duel in which players use paddles to deflect an explosive projectile. Instead of a normal ball, players are managing a bomb with a shortening timer, forcing them into high-pressure volleys where every hit matters.
### Players must:

* Deflect the bomb while anticipating ricochets off reflective walls

* Special abilities include Big Paddle, Slow Ball, Speed Up Paddle Movement

* Avoid being caught on the side where the bomb explodes

# 3. **Objective Statement**
### An arcade experience that amplifies tension, challenge, and engagement by replacing Pong’s static ball with a volatile, time-driven explosive object, encouraging players to balance precision, risk, and adaptability.
## Goals
* Create tension and suspense through the ticking timer mechanic

* Create moments of panic, excitement, and rapid adaptation

* Deliver the thrill of managing a dangerous object under pressure

* Reinvent classic pong using mechanics that increase unpredictability, player agency, and strategic decisions

# 4. Design Rationale
## Design Vision
### We envision Ricochet Rumble as a modern, chaotic evolution of Pong. It's a fast, competitive arcade experience that maintains Pong’s accessibility while adding depth, unpredictability, and emotional tension. The introduction of a ticking explosive object creates a “hot potato” dynamic that forces rapid decision-making and transforms every volley into a moment of mounting pressure.

### Evaluates complexity vs. simplicity:
* Tests whether meaningful complexity (bomb timer, ricochets, control scramble) enhances engagement or overloads the original simplicity of Pong.

* Maintains a familiar core (paddles + bouncing object) while adding layered decision-making.

### Encourage clever, skill-based play

* Players feel smart when predicting ricochet angles and using arena geometry to their advantage.

* Reflective walls, tight corridors, and teleporters create opportunities for advanced trick shots.

* Encourages planned setups, baiting strategies, and creative use of ability power-ups.

* Supports both casual play (simple controls) and competitive mastery (high skill ceiling).

### Escalate difficulty through evolving arena features

* Later arenas add more reflective surfaces, tighter chokepoints, and special abilities.

* Environmental hazards (momentary force fields or shifting walls) keep players adapting.

* Faster ricochet physics and increased bomb volatility raise the skill ceiling.

* Ensures constant adaptation and prevents repetitive gameplay.
