# Ricochet Rumble
A modern, chaotic evolution of classic Pong where the ball is replaced with a ticking explosive bomb. Players rally the bomb back and forth while navigating ricochets and power-ups while the timer grows shorter and tensions rise.


## Gameplay Overview
Ricochet Rumble is a 2D arcade, two-player competitive duel. Instead of a normal ball, players manage a bomb that becomes increasingly unstable as it is hit.

### Core Mechanics
- Ticking time-bomb ball that shortens with every paddle hit  
- Ricochets off reflective surfaces  
- Environmental hazards and tight corridors  
- Explosion stuns or scrambles the losing player’s controls  
- First to 10 points wins  

## Power-Ups
Players can collect temporary boosts during the match:

- **Big Paddle** – Increases paddle size for easier defense  
- **Slow Ball** – Lowers the bomb speed for a brief window  
- **Speed Up Paddle Movement** – Boosts paddle mobility
